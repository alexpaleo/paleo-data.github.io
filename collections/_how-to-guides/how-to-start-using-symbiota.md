This guide is designed orient new and prospective data providers to using Symbiota, a tool for managing and publishing fossil specimen data.

# Introduction
## What is Symbiota?
 <img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 0px 0px;" width="25%" src="/knowledge-hub/assets/images/symbiota_logo-lg.png" alt="Symbiota Logo" caption="Symbiota Logo">
[Symbiota](https://github.com/Symbiota/Symbiota) is open source software guided by the [Darwin Core](http://dwc.tdwg.org/terms) data standard for creating themed data portals to help people share and manage biodiversity data. The Symbiota code and a number of Symbiota-based portals are maintained by the [Symbiota Support Hub]((https://symbiota.org/about-us) (SSH).

{: .notice--info }
ðŸ“ƒ Prospective data providers may wish to reference the complete directory of [Symbiota portals](https://symbiota.org/symbiota-portals).

## What is the "Paleo Data Portal"?
The [Paleo Data Portal](https://paleo.symbiota.org) ("PDP") is a Symbiota-based data portal that exists to:
- Provide a low barrier-to-entry data mobilization platform for fossil collections
- Increase data access for research use
- Build community among fossil collections not previously engaged in digitization efforts
- Integrate with [PDWG](https://paleo-data.github.io/about)â€™s effort to develop best practices in paleo data management and publishing
- Provide a testing ground for technical solutions, e.g. those related to taxonomy

While the PDP is hosted by the SSH, the portal's [Steering Committee](https://paleo.symbiota.org/portal/misc/contacts.php) provides guidance on best practices related to the management of fossil specimen data.

## How to participate
If you manage a fossil collection and would like to use this portal to manage your specimen data, first carefully review the portal's [community guidelines](https://paleo.symbiota.org/portal/includes/usagepolicy.php) as well as the information on this website. After reviewing this information, if the portal seems suitable for your data management needs, please complete [this form](https://forms.gle/VGH9Rqg4ujpNcj1C8).

Data providers to this portal are **strongly** encouraged to participate in the [Paleo Data Working Group](https://paleo-data.github.io/) (PDWG). PDWG is community of practice for paleontology collections and informatics professionals who aim to develop and promote best practices for managing and digitizing fossil specimens. More information about how to participate in PDWG can be found [here](https://paleo-data.github.io/#how-to-get-involved). 

## Additional context
_Content forthcoming!_

# Software orientation
New data providers should reference the following content when learning to use Symbiota to share fossil specimen data.

## 1) Learn how to access key features in Symbiota
The following presentation provides an overview of Symbiota's most essential features used to access, manage, and publish fossil specimen data.

## 2) Learn how to manage specimen data using Symbiota
Carefully review [this guide](/knowledge-hub/how-to-guides/how-to-manage-specimen-data-using-symbiota) before contributing fossil specimen data to Symbiota portals. 

If you maintain existing digital catalog records in a spreadsheet, this information can (and should!) be imported into Symbiota. Data providers are strongly advised to review the [Symbiota data formatting guide](/knowledge-hub/how-to-guides/how-to-manage-specimen-data-using-symbiota#formatting-data-for-import) and complete the [related checklist]([/knowledge-hub/how-to-guides/how-to-manage-specimen-data-using-symbiota#formatting-data-for-import](/knowledge-hub/how-to-guides/how-to-manage-specimen-data-using-symbiota#data-formatting-checklist)) prior to ingesting specimen records into the portal. 

## 3) Develop a digitization workflow
Once oriented to Symbiota's key features and managing fossil specimen data using Symbiota, [this guide](/knowledge-hub/how-to-guides/how-to-develop-a-digitization-workflow-in-symbiota) will help you develop a strategy for digitizing your fossil specimens using a Symbiota portal.
