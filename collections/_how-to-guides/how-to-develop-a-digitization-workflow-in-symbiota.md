# Introduction

## Digitization workflows
In the context of this guide and other Knowledge Hub documentation, **"digitization"** is act of translating and capturing metadata describing a physical specimen into a digital form ([Nelson & Ellis, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2017.0391)). It encompasses the activities related to [cataloging](#cataloging), [georeferencing](#georeferencing), and [imaging](#imaging). 

Many paleontological collections are highly heterogeneous in nature--taxonomically, geographically, geologically, and physically. That is, one collection might contain fragmented elements of long-extinct and geologically recent vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants of varying sizes and shapes and in various states of physical preparation (e.g., from fully prepared specimens on exhibit to unopened field jackets and unwashed bulk samples‚Äîand many intermediate states). 

Careful planning is therefore necessary to efficiently digitize fossil specimen data in paleontological collections, and workflow development a critical part of this process. By developing and streamlining a thoughtful digitization workflow tailored to the nature of your collection (or a sub collection), you can maximize your collection‚Äôs visibility and research utility, in turn making it more likely to be used by researchers and thus further justifiable to administrators, potential funders, etc.

### Where to start 
Start by defining the goal of your digitization workflow. For instance, do you need to capture highly detailed specimen records for a specific research project, or is your aim to document core specimen data to make your collection more discoverable? Answering these questions will allow you to prioritize various workflow elements given the nature of your collection and resources available to complete the associated tasks (staff, equipment, etc.). The various workflows and associated guides herein are designed to help you design workflows that output discoverable, interoperable data to maximize their potential for research use in the context of the Paleo Data Ecosystem.

Symbiota software is particularly well-suited to is enabling flexible digitization workflows to quickly increase the digital presence of your collection‚Äîfor example, by facilitating the creation of skeletal specimen records that can be iteratively improved upon as time and resources allow. 

The content herein is tailor to Symbiota-based digitization workflows and is intended to be considered in parallel with the Knowledge Hub‚Äôs various [Symbiota how-to guides](/knowledge-hub/topics?topic=symbiota) and related content.

# Workflow components

## Cataloging and transcription

Sometimes "cataloging" is used interchangably with "trasncription" and "databasing". 


Because data transcription inherently involves judgement calls, and not all label data can be accurately represented using existing data standards, imaging specimen label images is recommended whenever possible. 

## Georeferencing

## Imaging
