Catalogue of Life (COL) is a collaboration that produces a resource for sharing and discovering digital taxonomic information across the tree of life. COL serves as the main taxonomic backbone for systems like GBIF. Data is sourced from experts, and ranges in scale from checklists compiled and published by individuals or research groups, to large taxonomic projects and aggregators, such as WoRMS.

Coverage of fossil taxa is highly variable, and mostly comes from data about a few extinct groups pulled from the Paleobiology Database. Input is needed from paleontologists to help expand this coverage. Expanded coverage for fossil taxa in COL would have positive downstream effects on the discoverability of fossil specimen data in global aggregators such as GBIF.
