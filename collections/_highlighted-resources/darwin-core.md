{: .notice--tip} Public review for a major set of proposed changes to Darwin Core is now happening. [Learn more and participate here](https://gbif.github.io/dwc-dp/).

[Darwin Core (DwC)](https://www.tdwg.org/standards/dwc/) is a data standard widely used by the biodiversity collections community, including for fossil specimens. It is primarily based on taxa, their occurrence in nature as documented by observations, specimens, samples, and related information. The standard is maintained by TDWG and actively evolving. Biodiversity aggregators such as GBIF use DwC to facilitate data mobilization.

Although data about fossil specimens can be shared via DwC, there are elements of the standard that merit additional attention from the paleo collections community, and possibly revision. PDWG is currently working on an implementation guide for DwC that will inform this work.
